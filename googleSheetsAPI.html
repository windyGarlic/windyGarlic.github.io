                    <p class="smaller-txt">I would like to start by saying I am by no means a developer. I've been learning python over the last year, and to be honest up until about a month ago, i was convinced I had no idea how to program. I knew all the basics, I just never had any practical application I could apply programming to. That was until I started a recent project that involved generating, sorting and storing massive data sets. I had written the tool to generate the data, but now I have thousands of texts files sitting on my computer with no structure. Thats when I came across Google Sheets API and the lightbulb went off. I was going to build a tool to put all of this data into its own individual cell in a spreadsheet.All of that to say, through this proses I have learned a few things, mostly that Google Sheets API with python is pretty cool.</p>

                    <h2>Set Up</h2>

                    <h3>Step 1: Authentication</h3>
                    <p class="smaller-txt"> There is a few things we do before we start, the first of which is setting up authentication. To access the sheet you will need to authenticate with your google account. For this we will need a file call credentials.json we can get that by <a href='https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project'> creating a new google cloud project here. </a></p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

                    <img style="height: 350px; width: 750px;" src="createPoject.png"> <br>
                    <img style="height: 350px; width: 750px;"  src="2namingProject.png"> <br>
                    <p class="smaller-txt"> Here we will create and name a project. This can be whatever you like.<br> After that we will click API and services and go to the credentials tab.</p>
                    <img style="height: 350px; width: 750px;"  src="3apiTab.png"> <br>
                    
                    <img style="height: 350px; width: 750px;"  src="4credTab.png"> <br>
                    <p class="smaller-txt"> Now we can click create credentials</p>
                    <img style="height: 350px; width: 750px;" src="5NamingOAuth.png"><br>
                    <p  class="smaller-txt">Again you can name this anything you like, just make sure it is a desktop app.</p>
                    <img style="height: 200px; width: 400px;"  src="6DownloadJsom.png"> <br>
                    <p class="smaller-txt">Now we download the json file and save it as credentials.json in the directory that we are working in.</p>

                    <p class="smaller-txt">After creating your Oauth client ID download and save it as credentials.json in the directory you will be working in.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Requirements</h3>
                    <p class="smaller-txt"> We will also need to get the python modules to start interacting with the sheets. run te following command: </p>

                    <pre class="code">pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
                    </pre>

                    <h2>Code</h2>

                    <p class="smaller-txt">We should have everything we need to start writing code. We will have to provide some information such as spreadsheet Id, were also going to want to implement code to generate a token so we don't have to authenticate every time.</p>


                    <pre class="code" >

                    </pre>
                    <p class="smaller-txt">Here are all the imports we will need. We also have two variables, SCOPES and SPREADSHEET_ID we will set the spreadsheet id later. There is also a function defined called auth() which will handle authentication and the creation of the token.<br> The next step will be to make two functions. One will be for handling querying data the other will export the data to the google sheet.</p>

                    If we run this code, we should see a link that we can use to sign in to our google account. Once we do this, token.json will be made and you will not need to authenticate until the token expires.<br> If we check the sheet we should see the data that we just uploaded.<br> Now to get that data back into python we can use the index() function.

                <article class="smaller-txt">We should see that data we just uploaded printed to our terminal. Obviously this is just an example, but you can see how this can be scaled up from here to handle massive data sets. The index function has many more use cases than just printing to the terminal. I have recently been using it in a workflow with matplotlib to directly make graphs based on the data in the spreadsheet. </article>
