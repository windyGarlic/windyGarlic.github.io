      <h2>About Me</h2></a>
      <p class='smaller-txt'>I've for the last year been working as an intern at a cyber security startup with a focus on DevSecOps. I have also just finished a cert 4 in cyber security. Recently ive been interested in web application penetration testing and programming and automation. </p>

      <h2>Accolades</h2>
      <p class="smaller-txt"> In my last year of education into cyber security I have competed in multiple  competitions including an incident response live fire competition, where my team and I placed 3rd against over 100 universities internationally. I also placed 2nd in a national networking/system administrator competition.</p>

      <h2>Currently Interests</h2>

      <ul class="smaller-txt" >
        <li><b>Python - </b> I use Python on a daily basis, usually to get something done quick, but i have recently been learning to write larger applications.</li><br>
        <li><b>Bash - </b>Linux is my native OS and I couldn't get anything done without bash so I love writing it, wether its a one liner or a 500 line bash script. </li><br>
        <li><b>Code Analysis - </b> Code review has been a big part of my journey while learning DevSecOps and web application vulnerability assessments.</li><br>
        <li><b>Incident Response - </b> The incident response competition i competed in was some of the most fun i've had. The final challenge was a scenario in which the attacker had taken down the splunk server during the attack, so our first job was to get that back online and start the investigation and remediation. I got hands on experience with tools like Splunk, Carbon Black EDR and the Windows SysInternal tools. </li><br>
        <li><b>Cloud Security - </b> This has been my most recent learning project, mostly working with AWS. Ive learned both configuring and securing cloud environments, as well as conducting cloud security assessments </li><br>
        <li><b>Web Application Security - </b> am learning this through participating in vulnerability disclosure programs. This has been a great way to learn common web vulnerability types and how they are exploited. This has also lead to a better understanding of best practice and secure coding standards. </li>
      </ul>
